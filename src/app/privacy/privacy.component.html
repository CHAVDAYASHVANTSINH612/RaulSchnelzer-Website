        I believe that privacy is a fundamental right. As such I do not set
        cookies or track your sessions while you are using this website.
        However, I use anonymised data for telemetry. In detail: counting page
        visits, server response time and failed requests are traced anonymously.
        I do not use Google Analytics or other Tools to correlate visitors and
        their browsing behaviour.
